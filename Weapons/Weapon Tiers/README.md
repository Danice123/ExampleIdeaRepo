## New Tree #1: Ballistic->Mag->Laser->Coil->Plasma
* Crediting original inspiration from Adamska
> Switching laser and mag just makes more aesthetic sense...  more advanced than the rifles that literally every advent troop is lugging around… XCOM has access to dozens of mag weapons from the second they start killing advent… xcom has had 20 years to figure it out… mag should be before laser.
## New Tree #2: Ballistic->Mag->Coil->Laser->Plasma
* Crediting DankNeutrino and Adamska with inspiration.
> its closer to a plasma weapon than a coil gun...Yeah it makes much more consistent sense that way...i always thought it was a bit strange it went from balistics to a beam weapon then back to projectiles for a bit before going back to beams again in the final tier
