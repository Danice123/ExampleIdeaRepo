# Magnetic
### Idea 1
* +10 Crit for Shotguns
> Fires Alloy Projectiles, will cause serious damage.
### Idea 2
* +15 Aim through High Cover
> Alloy projectiles going at a decent acceleration should punch through walls/objects pretty easily.
### Idea 3
* +1 Armor Penetration
> Fires Alloy projectiles going at a decent speed. Should punch through armor too.
### Idea 4
* +1 Ammo to all Mag Weapons
> Smaller munitions due to lack of need for inter-munition propulsion (gunpowder).
